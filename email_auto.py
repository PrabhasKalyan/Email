Dear {name},

I am a third-year B.S. Physics student at IIT Kharagpur with a strong background in AI and software development, seeking an opportunity to contribute to your team. My recent work at Filo involved building an AI pipeline to generate scalable, high-quality tutorial videos, combining NLP, TTS, and video automation.

I have also interned at Imago AI, TimechainLabs, and MoneyClub, developing systems like Text-to-SQL models, Slack‚ÄìJira automation, and RAG-based assistants. My projects such as LeadGen and Hunger Quest showcase my ability to build full-stack, scalable solutions using technologies like FastAPI, Go, Kafka, and Docker.

With leadership experience at E-Cell IIT Kharagpur and a passion for building impactful tech, I am excited about the chance to bring value to your team at {company}. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Prabhas Kalyan
